## About Me

I am a highly self-motivated senior undergraduate from Artificial Intelligence
special class and Zhiyuan honor Program in Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I had
sufficient experience in NLP research and always be passionate about diving into cutting-edge technology in
AI (especially in NLP). Details can be found in my [CV](https://zzh-sjtu.github.io/zhe_hao_Zhang.github.io/script/CV_2022.1.pdf).


<font color="#00dddd" size=3>I am always looking forword to chances of research assistant or intern in AI groups all over the world. Please contact me through [Email(zzh12138@sjtu.edu.cn)]if interested :smile:.</font><br /> 
## Research Interests
- **Natural Language Process:** Prompt design and transfer.
- **Deep learning:** Continual learning
## Publications
- EMNLP 2022 in submission. (First author)

## Skills

- **Programming Languages:** Python,C/C++, MATLAB (ranked by proficiency)
- **Tools and Frameworks:** Git, GitHub, LATEX, PyTorch, Numpy, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, huggingface transformers.
- **English ablility:** IELTS overall band score 7.5.

## Research Experience
-**Intern in [Stat NLP group](https://statnlp-research.github.io/)**
 -Under the
supervision of [Prof.Wei Lu](http://www.statnlp.org/faculty/lu_wei). Recently, I am working on interpretability of transformer and attention mechanism.

-**Class incremental learning with large doamin shift**
  -Existing class incremental learning method can not perform well with large domain shift within dataset. Under the
supervision of [Prof.Shuai Li](https://shuaili8.github.io), I am working on solve the catastrophic forgetting problem with large domain shift for the task of image classification.

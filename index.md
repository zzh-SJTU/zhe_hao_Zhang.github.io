# About Me

I am a highly self-motivated senior undergraduate from **Artificial Intelligence**
special class and Zhiyuan honor Program in Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I worded as a research assistant at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University** advised by [Prof.Shuai Li](https://shuaili8.github.io), **Singapore University of Technology and Design** advised by [Prof.Wei Lu](http://www.statnlp.org/faculty/lu_wei), and **Stanford University** working with [Prof.Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/). I had
sufficient experience in NLP research and always be passionate about diving into cutting-edge technology in AI (especially in NLP). Details can be found in my [CV](https://zzh-sjtu.github.io/zhe_hao_Zhang.github.io/script/CV_2022.11.22.pdf).


# Research Interests
- **Natural Language Process:**   Efficient Tuning of Pretrained Language Models (PLM), Roubstness of NLP models, Computational Social Science
- **Deep learning:**   Continual Learning, Transfer Learning

# Publications

# Research Experience
--**Research Assistant in Social and Language Technologies (SALT) Lab**
 -Under the
supervision of [Prof.Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/), We Utilized grammar induction and mutual information to search for biased grammar patterns on hate speech detection datasets. Analyzed the spuriousness of biased patterns, discovered identity biases using causal interference, and then proposed a method to mitigate such biases using a Multi-Task Intervention (MTI) and Data-Specific Intervention (DSI) based on the confounders. 
 -Validated the effectiveness of the method by running experiments and analyzing the results across 10 hate speech detection datasets with out-of-domain challenge set to reach positive conclusions on its use for reducing hate speech bias. **Over 5%** F-1 score improvement indicates the effectiveness of our method. This work will be submitted to **ACL 2023**.
 
-**Research Assistant in [John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/)**
 -Under the
supervision of [Prof.Shuai Li](https://shuaili8.github.io), I introduced context and label space information for prompt initialization in the setting of few-shot continual learning with state-of-the-art performance (**20.95% accuracy improvement** in 4-shot setting) in commonly-used text classification benchmarks. Successfully addressed catastrophic forgetting and fast adaptation simultaneously and submitted the work to **The Web Conference (WWW) 2023**..
 
-**Research Assistant in [Stat NLP group](https://statnlp-research.github.io/)**
 -Under the
supervision of [Prof.Wei Lu](http://www.statnlp.org/faculty/lu_wei), I systematically analyzed the architecture of Transformers and its variants (e.g., Linear Transformers) to implement a proof of concept  model from scratch for machine translation on WMT14 datasets, with comparative performance (bleu and perplexity) to the original.
 -Studied and presented the explainability of neural networks, especially from Neural Tangent Kernel’s perspective (NTK) through 4 comprehensive English oral presentations to Stat group meetings of over 30 members with strong positive feedback.

## About Me

I am a highly self-motivated senior undergraduate from Artificial Intelligence
special class and Zhiyuan honor Program in Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I had
sufficient experience in research and always be passionate about diving into cutting-edge technology in
AI. Details can be found in my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C-0Tqsn8Jc4v6p-JXqJ4rrv1kQlSB7B4/view?usp=sharing).


<font color="#00dddd" size=3>I am always looking forword to chances of research assistant or intern in AI groups all over the world. Please contact me through [Email(zzh12138@sjtu.edu.cn)]if interested :smile:.</font><br /> 
## Research Interests
- **Computer Vision:** Continual learning
- **Natural Language Process:** Machine translation, Transformer, Causal model
- **Deep learning:** continual learning, Domain adaptation
- **Reinforecement Learning** 

## My blog

- My private blog can be found at 

## Skills

- **Programming Languages:** Python,C/C++, MATLAB (ranked by proficiency)
- **Tools and Frameworks:** Git, GitHub, LATEX, PyTorch, Numpy, Scikit-learn, OpenCV.
- **English ablility:** IELTS overall band score 7.5.

## Research Experience
-**Intern in [Stat NLP group](https://statnlp-research.github.io/)**
 -Under the
supervision of [Prof.Wei Lu](http://www.statnlp.org/faculty/lu_wei). Recently, I am working on interpretability of transformer and attention mechanism.

-**Class incremental learning with large doamin shift**
  -Existing class incremental learning method can not perform well with large domain shift within dataset. Under the
supervision of [Prof.Wei Lu](https://shuaili8.github.io), I am working on solve the catastrophic forgetting problem with large domain shift for the task of image classification.

## Projects
- Implement a new algorithm to solve catastrophic forgetting in the setting of class incremental learning with domain shift.
- Implement transformer for machine translation with WMT14 dataset. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/zzh-SJTU/data_pre-process_translation).
- Implement hough transform (with edge detector, attribute finder) to find circles in several images. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/zzh-SJTU/Discounting).
- Implement a discounting method for language model. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/zzh-SJTU/Discounting).
- Project of machine learning course project on [adversarial attack](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UyfomQD2o9VoTRszNrMnbIuPy321HEEu/view?usp=sharing) and [defence](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-riEHaQwHDhv2VotrC7k88khkp8h7-n/view?usp=sharing) in Chinese. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/zzh-SJTU/Adversarial-Attacks-project).
